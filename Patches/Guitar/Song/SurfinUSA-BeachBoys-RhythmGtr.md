# Surfin' U.S.A. — The Beach Boys (Guitar)

Revised 2026-10-16 following the approved library audit.
Type: Song. Instrument: HSS Stratocaster.
Full board. Board Option: American Sound (bypassed; retained for legacy full-board builds).
Patch screen name: SurfinUSA-. Patch VOL: 52.
Preset tempo: 158 BPM.

**Instrument:** Stratocaster (HSS)
"Surfin' U.S.A." (1963), title track of the second album.
The melody is lifted from Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen", and the guitar follows Berry's playbook too.
Rhythm: a straight-8th boogie chug. Root-fifth to root-sixth shapes on the low strings, clean and bright.
Lead: Carl Wilson's Chuck Berry-style lines, double-stop bends and fast pull-offs.
Early-60s Fender clean everywhere. Spring reverb is part of the sound, but this is vocal surf, not a drenched Dick Dale instrumental. The reverb supports the parts, it doesn't wash them out.
Pickups: position 2 (bridge + middle) for the rhythm, bright and a little quacky, like a single-coil Fender. Position 1 (bridge humbucker) for the lead. It's thicker, and it hits the Green OD harder, so double-stops thicken up.

## Revision intent

Keep the musical role of the original patch while reducing redundant gain, excessive space and unclear switching where identified in audit entry 186.
The module settings and section map below are the active revision.
Audited capture volumes and Michael’s explicit patch-level adjustments are preserved.
No hardware audition or measured level match has been performed.

## GP-5 settings

Module order: NR -> PRE -> DST -> AMP -> CAB -> EQ -> MOD -> DLY -> RVB.
The encoded N->S block sits between DST and AMP when a SnapTone is used.

AMP/CAB replacement: SnapTone TwinClean (slot 61): CLEANEST - Fender Deluxe Reverb 1965 [Hyper Accuracy] + TWIN REVERB __ CLEAN (vulturized Twin).
Slot: 61. Always on.
Gain: 51, VOL: 75, Bass: 45, Middle: 50, Treble: 58.
AMP and CAB are both off; the capture already includes its cab/DI character.
The capture voice is fixed across CTL states. Audited VOL is preserved for this slot.

## NR - Gate

THRE: 18.
Fixed on. Not on CTL.
Use the lowest threshold that keeps rests quiet. Check soft notes and held-note decay. This gate is before the drives and amp; it does not directly gate noise generated after it.

## PRE - Module off

Not used.

## DST - Green OD

Gain: 18.
Tone: 60.
VOL: 68.
CTL assigned. Loads off; first CTL press switches it on.
Supplies the selected additional drive voice. Use its level and gain as separate controls. A pre-amp boost may add compression instead of a proportional solo-volume increase.

## AMP - Module off

Not used.

## CAB - Module off

Not used.

## EQ - Guitar EQ 1

125Hz: -3.
400Hz: -2.
800Hz: 1.
1.6kHz: 3.
4kHz: 1.
VOL: 50.
Fixed on. Not on CTL.
Shapes note body and cut after the amp/capture. Where assigned to CTL, its output adds the specified lift after the gain stages. Numbers are GP-5 control values, not a calibrated loudness guarantee.

## MOD - Module off

Not used.

## DLY - Slapback

Mix: 12.
Time: 110.
F.Back: 8.
Trail: on.
CTL assigned. Loads off; first CTL press switches it on.
Adds repeats only in the listed states. Trail preserves the remaining repeats when this block is bypassed; it does not change delay time or mix.

## RVB - Spring

Mix: 18.
Decay: 40.
Trail: on.
Fixed on. Not on CTL.
Adds the specified room or ambient tail. The revised mix keeps the initial note audible. Trail behavior follows the saved setting.

## Switching and section map

CTL blocks: DST, DLY.
- CTL off / loaded state: rhythm chug (verses, choruses). GP-5 active: NR, EQ, RVB, N->S.
- First CTL press: lead lines (intro fills and the instrumental break). GP-5 active: NR, DST, EQ, DLY, RVB, N->S.
- Press CTL again to return to the loaded block pattern, provided no shared MIDI block has been changed.

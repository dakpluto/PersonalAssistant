# Surfin' U.S.A. — The Beach Boys (Bass)

Revised 2026-10-16 following the approved library audit.
Type: Song. Instrument: Harley Benton passive 5-string P/J.
Full board. Board Option: American Sound (bypassed; retained for legacy full-board builds).
Patch screen name: SurfinUSA. Patch VOL: 55.
Preset tempo: 158 BPM.

Bass: Harley Benton P/J, 5-string, passive. Full board.
1963. ~158 BPM (estimate).
A straight-8th boogie line borrowed from the Chuck Berry playbook. Root-fifth-sixth walks under every chord, locked to the rhythm guitar's chug.
Early Beach Boys bass is picked, punchy and mid-forward. It follows the guitar pattern rather than sitting underneath as a sub-bass thump.
The bass is most often credited to Brian Wilson on this record.
Instrument setup:
- P pickup volume: full. J pickup volume: 0.
- Tone knob: about 60%. A little rolled off, with enough top left for the pick attack.
- Play with a medium pick, between the pickups. A light palm mute at the bridge keeps the 8ths short and bouncing.

## Revision intent

Keep the musical role of the original patch while reducing redundant gain, excessive space and unclear switching where identified in audit entry 111.
The module settings and section map below are the active revision.
Audited capture volumes and Michael’s explicit patch-level adjustments are preserved.
No hardware audition or measured level match has been performed.

## GP-5 settings

Module order: NR -> PRE -> DST -> AMP -> CAB -> EQ -> MOD -> DLY -> RVB.
The encoded N->S block sits between DST and AMP when a SnapTone is used.

AMP/CAB replacement: SnapTone CleanB15 (slot 51): Ampeg B18 - Head DI - Bass Chan - Vol 2.5 (B-18N) + Apg115.
Slot: 51. Always on.
Gain: 54, VOL: 80, Bass: 55, Middle: 55, Treble: 50.
AMP and CAB are both off; the capture already includes its cab/DI character.
The capture voice is fixed across CTL states. Audited VOL is preserved for this slot.

## NR - Gate

THRE: 15.
Fixed on. Not on CTL.
Use the lowest threshold that keeps rests quiet. Check soft notes and held-note decay. This gate is before the drives and amp; it does not directly gate noise generated after it.

## PRE - Micro Boost

Gain: 20.
CTL assigned. Loads off; first CTL press switches it on.
Controls the source dynamics or adds the specified push/filter before distortion and amp processing. The settings stay fixed; only its on/off state can change.

## DST - Module off

Not used.

## AMP - Module off

Not used.

## CAB - Module off

Not used.

## EQ - Bass EQ 2

50Hz: -2.
120Hz: 2.
400Hz: -1.
800Hz: 3.
4.5kHz: -2.
VOL: 52.
Fixed on. Not on CTL.
Shapes note body and cut after the amp/capture. Where assigned to CTL, its output adds the specified lift after the gain stages. Numbers are GP-5 control values, not a calibrated loudness guarantee.

## MOD - Module off

Not used.

## DLY - Module off

Not used.

## RVB - Module off

Not used.

## Switching and section map

CTL blocks: PRE.
- CTL off / loaded state: the verse/chorus line. GP-5 active: NR, EQ, N->S.
- First CTL press: Instrumental break and final choruses. GP-5 active: NR, PRE, EQ, N->S.
- Press CTL again to return to the loaded block pattern, provided no shared MIDI block has been changed.
